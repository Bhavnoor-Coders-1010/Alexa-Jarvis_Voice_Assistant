# Jarvis__Voice__Assistant
I have tried to make a voice assistant similar to Jarvis but not ML enabled just with the use of if-elif statements.. Hope that you'd like it!!

You can open the file in any Python IDE but make sure that you have the following libraries installed:
```
import pyttsx3
import datetime
import speech_recognition as sr
import wikipedia as wp
import webbrowser as wb
import os
import random
import pyautogui as pg
import csv
import smtplib as sl
import time
import screen_brightness_control as sbc
```
Thanks for visiting!
