# Jarvis__Voice__Assistant
I have tried to make a voice assistant similar to Jarvis but not ML enabled just with the use of if-elif statements.. Hope that you'd like it!!

You can open the file in any Python IDE but make sure that you have the following libraries installed:
```
import pyttsx3
import datetime
import speech_recognition as sr
import wikipedia as wp
import webbrowser as wb
import os
import random
import pyautogui as pg
import csv
import smtplib as sl
import time
import screen_brightness_control as sbc
```
Thanks for visiting!

(Don't forget to put the path of the file containing your time like this(do mention the sheet number and use an excel file only if you don't know how to import csv or txt files): "C:\Users\Lenovo\PycharmProjects\ATLHackathon\TIME TABLE IMPLANT - 1.xlsx", "Sheet1")
